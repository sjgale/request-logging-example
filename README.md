# Request Logging Example
A prototype demonstrating request error logging using AxiosJS. By catching errors on the request we can log any helpful information we need, this way no requests are missed and additional logging can be less.

This application is a simple prodedural app. After running `npm i`, the project can be run from terminal using `node .`; in order to make the requests fail, use the *-f* flag, like `node . -f`.
